Cave Of Solitude

An ancient legend tells of a secret treasure buried underneath the very soil of our mother earth when the time was young.

Most of the people have long since forgotten these stories, but some old folks have knowledge of a hidden passage. This passage is said to let one in, but never out.

Few courageous adventurers are known to have gone seeking this passage and never seen again. Maybe they have found it. Maybe not.

Truth remains that no one has come forward to claim to have found the treasure, which according to these few who have even some knowledge of it, possesses mysterious powers. Powers poured into it by the ones we call gods. Then hidden to a place where no mortal should ever survive if somehow discovered the entrance.

You are here to prove them wrong…

Standing next to a rock rising above the clouds you have spotted a faint writing on the seemingly solid surface of this silent, dark monument. After carefully studying the markings you whisper the words you recognize to be the same as the ones on a pendant you got years ago. It was said to be very old heirloom of your family.

You touch the stone that is no more solid. Your hand passes right through the surface. You take a deep breath and step into the darkness.

You are in…   (/ You immediately regret your decision…)
