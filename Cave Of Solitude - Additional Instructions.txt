-After your eyes get used to dark you start your journey to the depths…

-You have certain set of skills you can develop as you descend deeper towards the heart of the earth.

-These skills include:

--Strength: physical training that determines the severity of injuries inflicted by your sword…

--Dexterity: sharpness of your sight that gives you the ability to aim to vital spots and inflict more damage with your bow…

--Vitality: as your power grows, so does the thickness of your skin and blood enabling you to endure more blows…
